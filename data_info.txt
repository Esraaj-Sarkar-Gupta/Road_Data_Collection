Reading the data from road_data.txt:

==== # Boundary 
L: <latitude> , <longitude>; # Location
T: <time from unix epoch (milliseconds>; # Time
DA: # Device acceleration
X: <x_acceleration>,
Y: <y_acceleration>,
Z: <z_acceleration>;
==== # Boundary

Seperators:
The ';' is used to seperate different data types 
The '====' seperates different instances of data 
The ',' seperates discrete entities of every data type

Our axis of interest will differ based on the orientation of the device.
If the device is kept flat on its back, we will be looking at the Z axis (which is 9.8 m/s^2 at rest)
